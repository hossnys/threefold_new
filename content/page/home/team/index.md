 The ThreeFold Foundation is a not-for-proﬁt that expands the potential of ThreeFold Tech’s open-source technology. We are headquartered in Belgium, Dubai and Egypt, and have remote teams all around the world. Our team has worked on Internet storage and cloud technology since the ‘90s, and has earned world records for creating the most advanced infrastructures. We aim to create a peer-to-peer Internet and cloud that can host all of humanity’s digital workloads via smart contracts and run on a fully autonomous infrastructure without the need for traditional IT.
