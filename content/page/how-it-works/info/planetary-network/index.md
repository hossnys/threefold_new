# Planetary Network

Secure Planetary Network is an end-to-end encrypted global overlay network that implements the Yggdrasil initiative. It provides publicly accessible addresses to every connected device through a highly resilient and flexible routing scheme. ThreeFold protocols like the Reliable Message Bus extend these capabilities to serve the unique needs of the ThreeFold Grid.
