# ZStor

ZStor is a distributed and ultra secure storage backend. It compresses, encrypts, and disperses data across a set of Zdbs, to achieve strong resistance to even quantum computing attacks. Flexible configurations enable tuning according to preferences for efficiency, resiliency, and data location. Scales limitlessly and heals seamlessly.
