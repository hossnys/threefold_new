Zero-DB is a super fast and efficient always append database supporting a subset of the popular Redis protocol. It has superior write performance on hard disk and can also extend the life of solid state disks, while executing up to 50,000 transactions per second. Zero-DB is suitable out of the box for many database applications and is a building block for advanced storage solutions.
